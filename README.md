# The Timeline Game
Choose your category and drag the famous people to their right place on the timeline! Easily add more people and create your very own categories.

## Update (added after submission)
This was my final project for the [Harvard cs50 web course](https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-javascript)

I have now developed this project further and deployed it online so ***you* can try it out** over att [thetimeline.se](https://thetimeline.se). It's still under development but there are many new features and fixes done since this version. However i have not yet made the deployed version public on github, that will come when i have implemented even more features and fixed some bugs.  

Feel free to make contributions here on clone it and host it your self.

## How it works(in a nutshell) 

Backend *Django* with *Rest framework* has two models, Categories and People. Once the user selects their category and starts the game, ten people are randomly generated and sent to the frontend.
Frontend is powered by *React* and the rest of the game is then managed from here. When the game is over and the player wishes to play again, the page is simply refreshed and you can play again. 
The frontend is built up with components, shortly there are 3 components that does the most of the work(except for the App.js)

**Gamechoise.js** - Fetches all the categories and lets the player decide which one to play. There is also some logic that prevents the player from pressing the start button before there has been a category selected.

**Gameboard.js** - Here all the drag and drop code is. Also when the player is done with the game and submits the answers the checkTimeline function manages the logic by calculating which Person was placed at the right place and then generates the total points. 

Also here the handleResize function changes the game from a horizontal drag and drop to a vertical one if you are on a mobile(or low res screen).

**Card.js** - Except for all the card styling that is in the .css file, here the where the rightOrWrong function takes all the correctly placed Person turns them green and makes all the other, the wrongly placed cards red. Besides that it shows the user the right birth year for every Person when the game is finished.



## Distinctiveness and Complexity

I think that my project is clearly different in terms of code in many ways, mainly because I tested using *React*, which was not used in any tasks in the course (although it was presented a bit quickly in a lesson). Also what the page itself does differs a lot from the projects we worked on since my project is a game.

Besides that, I have tackled other parts that the course did not touch on such as, I used the *Rest Framework* with *Serializer* for the API. I also used the Python Random library to be able to send back randomly selected  data.

On the front end, I used *React* and *Beautiful DnD* (a Drag and Drop library) to make the game more interactive and that no previous task was about making the projects work for mobile devices, which this project does.

In conclusion, I think that this project does not resemble any previous project in the course while it fulfills the requirements,
It is *Django* on the backend
I have two models, One for Categories and one for Persons
As well as a large part of the project is *JavaScript (React)*
The page is also mobile friendly.


## How to run your application.

### Start the App:
Start the django server from the project root with:

	python3 manage.py runserver 

Move into frontend-folder to start react:

	npm start
(if the page does not open automatically visit http://localhost:3000/ in the browser)
